/*In a city, a survey is being conducted to identify special houses known as "peaks." 
A peak house is defined as one whose height is greater than its immediate neighbors. 
For houses on the boundary (first and last in the array), a peak is a house that is greater than its single neighbor.

Your task is to assist the surveyor by writing a program that identifies and prints the heights of all peak houses in sorted order.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer n (the number of houses).
Line-2: n distinct integers, representing the heights of the houses.

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: Print a list of peak house heights in sorted order.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (i.e., up to 100,000 houses)
Heights of houses are distinct and can be any integer between -10^9 and 10^9.

Definitions:
A peak house is a house where its height is greater than both its neighboring houses.
For the first house, it is a peak if it is greater than the second house.
For the last house, it is a peak if it is greater than the second-to-last house.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
8
9 4 5 3 8 7 10 11

Sample Output-1:
-----------------
[5, 8, 9, 11]

Explanation:
House heights 5, 8, 9, and 11 are peaks as they are greater than their neighboring houses.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[10]

Explanation:
Only 10 is a peak because it is greater than its only neighbor, 9.


Sample Input-3:
---------------
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Sample Output-3:
---------------
[10]

Explanation:
Only 10 is a peak because it is greater than 9, its only neighbor on the right.


Sample Input-4:
---------------
10
1 2 3 4 5 10 6 7 8 9

Sample Output-4:
---------------
[9, 10]

Explanation:
The houses 9 and 10 are peaks since they are greater than their immediate neighbors.
