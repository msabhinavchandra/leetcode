/*You are playing a game. There are N boxes placed in a row (0-indexed), 
every box has some points. You need to play the game with the following rules:
	- Initially your score is  '0' points.
	- Suppose the box has P points in it.
	  if p>0 you will gain P points, if p<0 you will loose P points.
	- You are allowed to choose any number of consecutive boxes, atleast 1 box.
	
You are given the points in the N boxes as points[]. 
Your target is to maximize your score, and return the highest score possible. 

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N.
Line-2: N space separated integers, points[].

Output Format:
--------------
An integer, print the highest score.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
9
-3 1 -2 4 -2 2 3 -5 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
7

Explanation:
------------
By selecting consecutive boxes are [4,-2,2,3] has the highest score is 7


Sample Input-2:
---------------
2
1 -2

Sample Output-2:
----------------
1

Explanation:
------------
By picking the box is [1] has the highest score is 7 */
