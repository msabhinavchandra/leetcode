/*You are given a sorted list of integers with no duplicates. 
Your task is to find and group continuous ranges of numbers. 
Each group should represent the smallest and largest numbers in the continuous range using the format start->end. 
If a number does not belong to any range (i.e., it stands alone), it should be added as a single number without the -> symbol.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: A single line containing space-separated integers in sorted order.

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: Print a list of continuous ranges, where each range is represented as start->end for continuous numbers or as a single number if no range exists.

Constraints:
-------------
-The input list contains no duplicates.
-The list is sorted in ascending order.
-The list may contain only a single number or multiple numbers that form various continuous ranges.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 2 4 5 7

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[1->2, 4->5, 7]

Explanation:
------------
The numbers 1 and 2 form a continuous range, represented as 1->2.
The numbers 4 and 5 form another continuous range, represented as 4->5.
The number 7 stands alone.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
1 2 3 5 6 7 9 10 12

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[1->3, 5->7, 9->10, 12]

Explanation:
-------------
The numbers 1, 2, and 3 form a continuous range, represented as 1->3.
The numbers 5, 6, and 7 form another continuous range, represented as 5->7.
The numbers 9 and 10 form another range.
The number 12 stands alone.

Sample Input-3:
---------------
1 3 5 7 9

Sample Output-3:
----------------
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Explanation:
-------------
All numbers in this list stand alone, so they are printed individually.
