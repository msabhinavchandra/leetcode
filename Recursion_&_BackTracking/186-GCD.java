/*
Given an integer array nums, return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the smallest number and the largest number in the array.

The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

Constraints:
-------------
2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1000

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer, represents size of array
Line-2: A single integer array nums of length between 2 and 1000, where each element is a positive integer ans space separated.

Output Format:
--------------
Line-2: Return the GCD of the smallest and largest numbers in the array.

Sample Input-1:
--------------- 
2 5 6 9 10

Sample Output-1: 
-----------------
2

Explanation:
The smallest number is 2 and the largest number is 10.
The GCD of 2 and 10 is 2.


Sample Input-2: 
---------------
7, 5, 6, 8, 3

Sample Output-2: 
----------------
1

Explanation:
The smallest number is 3 and the largest number is 8.
The GCD of 3 and 8 is 1.
