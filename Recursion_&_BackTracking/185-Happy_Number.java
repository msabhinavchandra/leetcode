/* 
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is a happy number.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will remain), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
If the number eventually reaches 1, then the number is happy. Otherwise, it is not.

Constraints:
-------------
1 ≤ n ≤ 2³¹ - 1
You must handle the case of both happy and non-happy numbers.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: A single integer n, representing the number to be checked.

Output Format:
---------------
Line-1: Return true if the input number is a happy number, otherwise return false.


Sample Input-1: 
----------------
19

Sample Output-1: 
-----------------
true

Explanation:
Process to determine if 19 is a happy number:
1² + 9² = 1 + 81 = 82
8² + 2² = 64 + 4 = 68
6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1 (since the number reached 1, 19 is a happy number)


Sample Input-2: 
----------------
2

Sample Output-2: 
-----------------
false

Explanation:
The process does not reach 1 and starts repeating numbers. Hence, 2 is not a happy number.
